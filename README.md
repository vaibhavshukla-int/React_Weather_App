# React_Weather_App

## Description

React_Weather_App is created to learn about how to build the react app and how to integrate the open api in the react application.

Here i utilized OpenAPI to retrieve current weather data for specified cities and integrated RapidAPI's GeoAPI to provide the auto complete search functionality for city names.

This project provided hands-on experience in developing full-stack web applications using React and integrating with exteranl APIs. It also allowed me to improve my skills in UI design, data visualization and code optimization.
